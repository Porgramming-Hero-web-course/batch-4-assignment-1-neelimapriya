## Why are Type Guards Necessary?
Type guards in TypeScript are necessary because this help us determine the exact type of a variable in a specific part of the code. They’re especially helpful when working with union types or when TypeScript isn’t able to figure out a variable’s type on its own. By using type guards, we can check a variable's type at runtime, allowing us to write safer and more predictable code that behaves as expected.
